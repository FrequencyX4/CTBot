## Reporting a Vulnerability
To report a vulnerability, contact a developer (Luck#1574 or ProgrammerPlays#8264). If there are no developers online, create an Issue titled "Vulnerability Report". **DO NOT INCLUDE THE VULNERABILITY IN THE ISSUE!!!** Instead, leave a proper way to contact you. We will get in touch with you as soon as we can to fix the vulnerability as fast as possible.
