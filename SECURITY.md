## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability with the bot, contact an online, active developer like Luck or ProgrammerPlays (ProgrammerPlays#8264). If there are no active devs online, create an Issue titled "Vulnerability Report". DO NOT INCLUDE THE VULNERABILITY IN A PUBLIC ISSUE. Please leave a proper way to contact you about the vulnerability. We will contact you as soon as we see it to get the vulnerability patched as fast as possible.
