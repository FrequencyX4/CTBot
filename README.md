## What are the Followers of the Crafting Table?
The Followers of the Crafting Table are a semi-religious group created on 2b2t 
in January 2020. We make builds with/of crafting tables like the Crafting Table 
Valley or the super-sized crafting tables that are now common close to spawn. 

## How can I set up a development mirror?
Setting up a development mirror greatly helps us in case our main VPS goes down, and also allows us to test new features.
> Join the Discord

At the top of this README file there is a link to join the dev Discord. You must join it to have your mirror recognized.

> Install onto a 24/7 server

Following the installation instructions, run the bot on a server going 24/7. You can just leave a computer, RPi, or Arduino on long-term to do this.

> Ask the devs to recognize the mirror

On approval of your mirror, the devs will add it to the development Discord for testing.
